# Linear-Regression-Student-Scores
This project demonstrates a simple linear regression model to predict student scores based on study hours.
📈 Linear Regression: Student Scores Prediction

This project implements a simple Linear Regression model using Python and scikit-learn to predict student scores based on the number of hours studied. It uses a small publicly available dataset to demonstrate the relationship between study time and performance.

🔍 Project Objective

Build a predictive model using Linear Regression

Train it on a dataset of student study hours and scores

Evaluate performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Visualize the regression line and model accuracy


🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 3
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
scikit-learn

📁 Dataset
The dataset contains:
Hours studied per day
Scores achieved by students

It is sourced from:
📂 student_scores.csv
